# Roadmap: UsemePortfolio

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a complete freelancer portfolio for Useme.com through five phases: foundation with shared design system, web projects (portfolio site + landing page), two iOS app vertical slices (Habit Tracker and Expense Calculator, each with native app + web demo), and final integration with Useme profile optimization. Each phase delivers working, verifiable software that proves AI-assisted development capability.

## Phases
